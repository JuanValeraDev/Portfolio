### Who am I?

Hi, I'm Juan, a passionate full stack software developer. My focus is on creating web apps with React, Next.js and
Vercel. I love creating innovative solutions and collaborating with teams. Over the years, I've gained valuable
experience working with diverse groups, enhancing both my technical and interpersonal skills.

I thrive on the challenges of programming and enjoy using creativity to solve complex problems. What excites me most is
the collaborative aspect of software development, where teamwork and communication lead to the best outcomes.

For me, software development is the perfect mix of technical skill and human connection. I'm always eager to learn new
technologies and methodologies, and I look forward to connecting with others who share my passion.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio. Let's connect!
