# Projects

Here you can find some of the projects I have worked on.

## <a href="https://github.com/JuanValeraDev/InfoCountries" target="_blank">Infocountries</a>

This is a project made with my partner <a href="https://github.com/VictorGlvez" target="_blank">Víctor Gálvez</a>. It is
related to countries information. You can search for information about a country, see a gallery of images, make a
comparation between two countries and play a quiz about countries.

This project is made with React, Bootstrap, Express and API consumption, like chatgpt 3.5 turbo, restcountries or
pexels. It is located on <a href="https://infocountrieswebservice.onrender.com/" target="_blank">Render</a>.

## EduManage with Jetpack Compose

EduManage is an Android application developed with Jetpack Compose and Kotlin, designed to manage
departments, classrooms, and incidents. The application leverages the power of the MVVM architecture, state management,
and navigation components.
It incorporates both local and cloud-based storage solutions, utilizing SQLite with Room library for local data
persistence and Firebase for cloud storage. The application also features preference storage for personalized user
settings. Advanced features include result filtering, index creation in databases, and the use of design patterns such
as Singleton and Dependency Injection.
