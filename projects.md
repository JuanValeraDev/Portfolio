## <a href="https://github.com/JuanValeraDev/Podhouse" target="_blank">Podhouse</a>

This is a little project I did to practice HTML, CSS, Javascript and responsive design. It is a very simple page that
offers pieces of humor podcasts.

## EduManage with Jetpack Compose

EduManage is an Android application developed with Jetpack Compose and Kotlin, designed to manage
departments, classrooms, and incidents. The application leverages the power of the MVVM architecture, state management,
and navigation components.
It incorporates both local and cloud-based storage solutions, utilizing SQLite with Room library for local data
persistence and Firebase for cloud storage. The application also features preference storage for personalized user
settings. Advanced features include result filtering, index creation in databases, and the use of design patterns such
as Singleton and Dependency Injection.
